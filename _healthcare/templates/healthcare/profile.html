                            <h1>MileagePlus Program Rules</h1><p>Important: The following are the rules and other provisions (collectively, "Rules") of the MileagePlus® program, which includes but is not limited to the accrual and redemption of miles, awards and benefits and Premier® and Million Miler benefits, (collectively, the "Program"). By enrolling or participating in the Program, you indicate your acceptance of these Rules and agree to abide by them. It is your responsibility to read and understand all of the Rules. For more information, contact the MileagePlus Service Center or visit the MileagePlus website at mileageplus.com. These Rules cannot be superseded or changed, except in writing from United Airlines or any of its affiliates (collectively, "United"). The most current Rules may be found on united.com and this is the final authority on the Rules. The Rules on united.com shall be deemed to supersede any prior or conflicting versions thereof.</p>
                                <p>General conditions</p>
                                <p>1. The Program is offered at the discretion of United and United has the right to terminate the Program, in whole or in part, or to change the Rules, benefits, conditions of participation, Premier (and/or Million Miler) qualification criteria or mileage levels, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice, even though changes may affect the value of Premier (and/or Million Miler) status levels, benefits, mileage or certificates already accumulated. United may, among other things, withdraw, limit, modify or cancel any award; increase the mileage, cash required, applicable co-pays or number of certificates required for any award; modify benefits associated with Premier (and/or Million Miler) status; modify Premier (and/or Million Miler) qualification criteria; modify or regulate the transferability of awards or benefits; add an unlimited number of blackout dates; or limit the number of award seats available to any or all destinations. Members of the Program ("Members"), in accumulating any benefits of any kind including but not limited to certificates, mileage, and (to the extent applicable) Premier qualifying dollars ("PQD"), Premier qualifying segments ("PQS"), Premier qualifying miles ("PQM"), Premier Qualifying Flights ("PQF") or Premier Qualifying Points("PQP," together with PQD, PQS, PQM, PQF or any future type of Premier qualification metric (each, to the extent applicable), "Premier Qualifying Credits"), may not rely upon the continued availability of (a) the benefits associated with a Premier (and/or Million Miler) status level or (b) an award or award level, and Members may not be able to obtain all offered benefits or awards or use awards to all destinations or on all flights. For the purpose of calculating Premier qualification requirements earned in 2020, or after, to qualify for Premier status with respect to the 2021 program year or after, the definition of "Premier Qualifying Credits" shall include PQP and PQF and any other Premier qualification metric United determines to use in its sole discretion. United reserves the right to make bonus and promotional offers by United or MileagePlus Partners selectively available to certain Members at any time, based on flight activity, Partner (defined below) activity, geographic locations, Premier status level, mileage accumulation, Program participation, or other factors determined at United's sole discretion. Mileage redemption activity (and processing of any mileage redemption requests for any awards, certificates or benefits, including without limitation any Premier (and/or Million Miler) status benefits, if applicable) may be prohibited in any MileagePlus account or suspended for a period of time after the opening of the MileagePlus account.</p>
                                <p>2. The Rules control your membership and participation in the Program and no covenants at law or in equity shall be implied or incorporated, all of which are expressly disclaimed. United has the sole right to interpret and apply the Rules. IF UNITED OR A PARTNER IMPROPERLY DENIES AN ACCRUAL OR BENEFIT, LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE EQUIVALENT VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY UNITED, OR THE PARTNER AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF THAT ACCRUAL OR BENEFIT. IN NO EVENT SHALL UNITED BE LIABLE TO A MEMBER, OR ANYONE ACTING ON THE MEMBER’S BEHALF, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST REVENUE OR PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF UNITED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, OR COSTS OR ATTORNEYS’ FEES. Any abuse of the Program or failure to follow the Rules, United’s Contract of Carriage, United’s fare rules, Partner rules, terms and conditions or any abuse of any Partner offers or programs, any violation of law, rule, or regulation, any conduct detrimental to the interests of United, any fraudulent activity or attempted fraudulent activity, any dissemination of information designed to defraud United, or any misrepresentation of any information furnished to United or its affiliates by any Member, anyone else acting on the Member's behalf, or any third party (collectively, "Prohibited Conduct"), may result in United exercising any one or more of the following remedies ("United’s Remedies"), with or without notice to the Member: (a) the termination by United of such Member’s membership (including without limitation any Premier or Million Miler status, if applicable), (b) the removal or cancellation by United of any or all accrued mileage, Premier Qualifying Credits, lifetime miles, and any pending or outstanding award redemptions, certificates, or benefits (including without limitation any benefits associated with Premier (and/or Million Miler) status, if applicable), (c) the confiscation of any award tickets, denial of boarding with respect to any award ticket holders or, at United's discretion, completion of the travel only upon payment of an applicable revenue fare (and applicable taxes and fees), or (d) the loss of other Program benefits. In addition to the foregoing United’s Remedies, United may, upon written request, require the Member to repay the value, as determined by United, of the awards redeemed, certificates or benefits acquired as a result of Prohibited Conduct and, in the event of a Member’s failure to repay, may initiate legal action to recoup the value of awards redeemed, certificates or benefits acquired by the Member through Prohibited Conduct. Members whose accounts have been terminated shall not be eligible to participate in any aspect of the Program and shall not be eligible to enroll with new accounts unless express consent is received from United.</p>
                                <p>3. In the event United suspects Prohibited Conduct, United reserves the right, with or without notice to the Member, (a) to delay or suspend all activity (including without limitation any mileage redemption activity and processing of any mileage redemption requests for any awards, certificates or benefits, including without limitation any Premier (and/or Million Miler) status benefits) in any MileagePlus account, and (b) to audit or investigate any MileagePlus account at any time. During the course of an audit or investigation, a Member’s account information may be shared with any third party with whom United has contracted to assist in performing such audit or investigation. While the account is suspended, the Member may continue to accrue miles and Premier Qualifying Credits in the account, but no mileage redemptions or other transactions will be permitted and any outstanding award redemptions, certificates and benefits (including without limitation any Premier (and/or Million Miler) status benefits, if applicable) will be subject to cancellation or suspension. Cancelled award redemptions, certificates and benefits must be surrendered to United upon United’s request. Upon completion of the audit or investigation, if Prohibited Conduct has been detected by United, United may exercise any one or more of United’s Remedies or any other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>
                                <p>4. Each Member is responsible for being and remaining knowledgeable as to the Rules and the amount of mileage in such Member’s account. A Member shall notify United promptly of any error in the Member's MileagePlus account such as an erroneous mileage balance, certificate balance, PlusPoints balance or other credit balance (e.g. TravelBank). In the event a Member’s mileage balance, certificate balance, PlusPoints balance, credit balance, or other balance offered by MileagePlus is erroneously credited for any reason, the Member’s use of such erroneously credited benefit shall constitute a violation of these Program Rules. United may, but shall have no obligation to, send newsletters, statements, correspondence or other materials, including notifications of Program changes or special promotions. Each Member shall be responsible for advising United of any change of contact information and United shall have no liability for misdirected correspondence or any consequences thereof.</p>
                                <p>5. YThe accumulation of mileage, certificates, PlusPoints and/or Premier Qualifying Credits and/or the redemption of awards are subject to these Rules. The accumulation of mileage, certificates, PlusPoints and/or Premier qualification and/or Premier status (or Million Miler status), and other credits and benefits do not entitle Members to any vested rights with respect to the Program, including without limitation, any awards or Premier benefits (or Million Miler benefits). No mileage, benefits, certificates, PlusPoints, Premier Qualifying Credits, account numbers, Premier (and/or Million Miler) status or awards earned or granted under the Program may be transferred or assigned except as expressly permitted by United in writing or under programs fully authorized and/or sponsored by United.</p>
                                <p>6. The Program is maintained for the benefit of United and individual Members. Only individuals are eligible for MileagePlus membership, and each individual may maintain only one account in the Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MileagePlus may, in certain circumstances, permit Members who are not individuals to participate in the Program, subject at all times to the provisions of Rule 39 and any other limitations set forth by MileagePlus in its sole discretion. Duplicate accounts in the Program will be subject to cancellation. Generally, mileage, benefits, certificates, PlusPoints, Premier Qualifying Credits, Premier (and/or Million Miler) status or awards earned or granted in two or more different accounts may not be combined. If a Member maintains multiple accounts and United suspects or finds Prohibited Conduct, United reserves the right to exercise United’s Remedies with respect to each account. Only the Member named on the account will be entitled access to account information. Account information is United's proprietary information and, except as otherwise authorized by United, Members may access information only for the purpose of obtaining information about their account. Each Member is responsible for ensuring account credentials are not shared, distributed, or given to any other individual and no Member may delegate or grant access (via power of attorney, contract, or otherwise) to a third party. Any Member who shares account information with any third party will be held responsible for such third-party’s actions with respect to the Account. Account information may be reproduced for use by the applicable Member but must contain copyright and proprietary notices and redistribution in any way requires United's written permission.</p>
                                <p>7. Awards and benefits, including accrued mileage, Premier (and/or Million Miler) status levels, Premier (and/or Million Miler) benefits, PlusPoints, Premier Qualifying Credits and certificates do not constitute property of the Member and are not transferable except as set forth herein. Accrued mileage may be transferred to another MileagePlus account through United’s Transfer Miles Program. Members must comply with the Transfer Miles Program Terms and Conditions found on united.com. In the event of the death or divorce of a Member, United may, in its sole discretion, credit all or a portion of such Member’s accrued mileage to authorized persons upon receipt of documentation satisfactory to United and payment of applicable fees.</p>
                                <p>8. All calculations made in connection with the Program, including without limitation, the value of any benefits, the accumulation of mileage, the satisfaction of the qualification requirements for Premier (or Million Miler) benefits and achievement of Premier status, and/or the revisions of calculations (including without limitation any estimates), will be made by United in its discretion and such calculations will be considered final.</p>
                                <p>9. Neither United’s waiver or consent to a deviation from the Rules nor any course of dealing shall be construed as a waiver by United of any subsequent violation of the Rules and United may invoke United’s Remedies for a violation of the Rules despite any such prior waiver or consent.</p>
